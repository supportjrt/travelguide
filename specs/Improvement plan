Travel Solution Improvement Plan
This document outlines a strategic plan to enhance the Travel Guide application, focusing on user engagement, discovery, and conversion.

1. Interactive Itinerary Map
   Goal: Visualize the journey to make it more tangible and exciting for the user.

Feature: Embed a dynamic map (using Leaflet or Mapbox) on the Package Details page.
Functionality:
Show the route connecting cities in the itinerary.
Interactive markers for each city/stop.
Clicking a marker scrolls the itinerary to the relevant day.
Tech: Use react-leaflet (free, open source) with OpenStreetMap.
Data Requirement: Add latitude/longitude coordinates to the city data. 2. Advanced Search & Filtering
Goal: Help users find their perfect trip faster as the catalog grows.

Current State: Basic text search in
PackageSelector
.
Improvement: Add structured filters.
Price Range: Slider for min/max budget.
Duration: Filter by "Short (< 10 Days)", "Medium (10-15 Days)", "Long (> 15 Days)".
Destinations: Multi-select dropdown for specific countries (e.g., "France", "Italy", "Swiss").
UI: A collapsible filter sidebar or top bar in the Package Selector. 3. Package Comparison Tool
Goal: Empower users to make informed decisions by comparing options side-by-side.

Feature: "Compare" capability.
UX:
"Add to Compare" checkbox on Package Cards.
Floating "Compare Bar" at the bottom showing selected items (max 3).
Comparison View: A modal or separate page showing a table comparing:
Price
Duration
Countries visited
Key Inclusions (e.g., flight included, meals)
Pace (Relaxed vs Fast) 4. Wishlist / Favorites
Goal: Capture high-intent users who aren't ready to book immediately.

Feature: "Save for Later" functionality.
UX: Heart icon on package cards.
Storage: Persist to local storage (no login required initially).
Access: A "My Saved Trips" link in the header. 5. Enhanced Booking/Enquiry Flow
Goal: Increase lead quality and reduce friction.

Current State: Simple contact form (
ConnectDialog
).
Improvement: Context-aware multi-step enquiry wizard.
Step 1: Trip Details (Preferred Dates, Number of Adults/Children).

Step 3: Preferences (Budget, Special Occasion, Customization needs).
Benefit: Provides the sales team with richer data. 6. Content Integration (Blogs)
Goal: Inspire users and improve SEO.

Feature: "Travel Stories & Tips" section on Package pages.
Logic: If a package visits "Paris", dynamically show blog posts tagged with "France" or "Paris".
Benefit: Keeps users engaged on the site longer. 7. Social Proof & Trust
Goal: Build confidence.

Implementation:
Add a reviews array to the Package model.
